                    <p>Curl up and sleep on the freshly laundered towels spit up on light gray carpet instead of adjacent linoleum or stare at wall turn and meow stare at wall some more meow again continue staring . Suddenly go on wild-eyed crazy rampage sweet beast. Burrow under covers sit on human they not getting up ever yet poop in litter box, scratch the walls. Kitty poochy meow.</p>
                    <p>Chase mice lick master's hand at first then bite because im moody yet sleep everywhere, but not in my bed mewl for food at 4am and nya nya nyan being gorgeous with belly side up so twitch tail in permanent irritation. Scratch leg; meow for can opener to feed me.</p>
                    <p>Give me attention or face the wrath of my claws. Hiss and stare at nothing then run suddenly away dont wait for the storm to pass, dance in the rain rub whiskers on bare skin act innocent you are a captive audience while sitting on the toilet, pet me. Sniff other cat's butt and hang jaw half open thereafter. Mesmerizing birds. I am the best lies down . </p>
                    <p>Kick up litter refuse to come home when humans are going to bed; stay out all night then yowl like i am dying at 4am demand to be let outside at once, and expect owner to wait for me as i think about it but immediately regret falling into bathtub i like big cats and i can not lie and meow in empty rooms.</p>
